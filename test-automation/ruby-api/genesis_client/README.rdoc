= Simple OpenGenesis client
== Usage

Root resource is created with method Genesis.resource (see below). You should pass
a symbol to identify resource under root /rest. Also classes or modules including module
Genesis must have an instance variable @config to operate correctly. This variable is a hash
with elements:

- host - Host running Genesis
- port - Port Genesis listen on
- user - User to authenticate
- password - Password to use

Last two elements can be overriden with additional parameter to resource method:

  resource :project, :username => 'foo', :password => 'bar'

=== Direct use of Genesis::Resource

  resource = Genesis::Resource.new("projects", {"host" => "localhost", "port" => 8080, "user" => "genesis", "password"=> genesis})

or

  resource = Genesis::Resource.new("projects", {"host" => "localhost", "port" => 8080}, :username => genesis, :password => genesis})


=== Dynamic finders

Genesis::Resource may search items based on criteria. For example, Project items contains a field 'name'. To search by this field you may
use following syntax:

  project = resource :projects do |resource| 
    resource.find_by_name('name')
  end

=== Nested resources

Nested resources can be created with nested_resource method of module Genesis. For example, to get resources for environments under project
with id = 1, use:

  env_resource = nested_resource :projects, 1, :environments

This can be combined with finders too. For example, if you have project named 'test':

  test_envs = resource :projects do |resource|
    resource.find_by_name('test') do |project|
      nested resource :projects, project["id"], :environments
    end
  end

=== Overriding default credentials

resource and nested_resource method can accept additional arguments to override credentials in default @config variable:

 resource :path, :username => 'user', :password => 'password' do |r|
    r.get
    ...
 end

=== Using in Cucumber helper

(Copied from OpenGenesis tests)

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'genesis_client'

  include Genesis
  module ModelHelpers
    ...
  end

  class GenesisWorld
    include Genesis
    include ModelHelpers
    def initialize
      yaml = YAML::load(File.open(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../../config.yml"))
      @config = yaml["genesis"]
    end
  end

  World do
    GenesisWorld.new
  end

=== Almost full example

  require 'genesis_client'

  class GenesisHelper include Genesis
    def initialize(...)
      @config = ....
    end

    def create_project
      resource :projects do |resource|
        resource.post { :name => "project", :projectManager => "manager" }
      end
    end

    def update_project
      resource :projects do |resource|
        resource.put 1, { :name => "renamed", :projectManager => "manager" }
      end
    end

    def delete_project
      resource :projects do |resource|
        resource.delete 1
      end
    end

    def find_by_name(name)
      resource :projects do |resource|
        project = resource.find_by_name("renamed")
      end
    end
  end
